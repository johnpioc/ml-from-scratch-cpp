# Machine Learning From Scratch (C++)

Implementations of several Machine Learning models from scratch in C++ with runtime & model accuracy comparisons to equivalent implementations in Python's Tensorflow.

### Motivation

I built this project in an effort to learn more about high-performance C++, C++ Industry practices and machine learning. Absolutely no generative A.I. was used to implement the model, and I attribute my learning to the following textbooks:

- **Introduction to Statistical Learning** by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani
- **C++ High Performance** by Andrist and Sehr
- **Beautiful C++** by Davidson and Gregory
- **C++ Software Design** by Iglberger
